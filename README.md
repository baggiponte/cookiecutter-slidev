## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

* The file `slides.md` sources QR code from `./public/` that point to my personal GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. This is just an example: make sure you remove them!
* The `public/qr-github.svg` is missing: you should generate a new one, e.g. using [qrcode-monkey.com](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/) (not affiliated, just the one I use).
